## Security Measures

### Command Injection Prevention

The extension implements several layers of protection against command injection attacks:

1. **Path Validation**: All file paths are validated to prevent directory traversal attacks
2. **Safe Shell Escaping**: Platform-specific shell escaping for command execution
3. **Process Spawning**: Use of secure process spawning with timeouts
4. **Input Sanitization**: Validation of all user inputs before processing

### Environment Discovery Security

- **Timeout Protection**: All external command executions have strict timeouts
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failed commands without exposing system information
- **Safe Path Handling**: Validation of environment paths to prevent malicious path injection

### Terminal Security

- **Secure Command Construction**: Commands are built using validated and escaped components
- **Limited Execution**: Only predefined, validated commands are executed
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal of terminal resources to prevent resource leaks
